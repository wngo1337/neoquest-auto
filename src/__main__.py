"""This program handles travelling and battling in Neoquest to provid easy game completion.
It is based on a specific playthrough strategy that consists of the following areas in order:

1. The Dank Caves
2. The Jungle Ruins -> Kreai and Gors can get tricky since they have stun + big damage
3. The Techo Mountain Caves and Mountain Fortress
4. Kal Panning
5. Two Rings Palace

This program skips the Temple of Roo and the intermediate weapon upgrades in favour of
transferring directly from the Jungle Ruins to the Mountain Fortress for final upgrades."""
